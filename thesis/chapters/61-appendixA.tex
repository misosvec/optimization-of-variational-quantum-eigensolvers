\chapter{Source code}
All source files for this project are publicly available in this GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/misosvec/optimization-of-variational-quantum-eigensolvers}. Files \texttt{ansatzes.py} and \texttt{optimizers.py} handle an initialization of ansatzes and optimizers. File \texttt{benchmark.py} runs the VQE in a multiprocessing manner and saves produced data to a CSV file. Juptyer notebook \texttt{visualizations.ipynb} contains all visualizations of circuits, qubits, and gates used in our thesis. Plots representing results are located in file \texttt{results.ipynb}.
